# To-do List 

A to-do list created as a project for The Odin Project. The to-do list allows users to save projects and tasks in local storage on the browsers. The projects have a name, description, and store tasks. Tasks have a name, description, due date, and priority. 

## Getting Started

A working version of the page can be found on the Github pages of this repository. 

## Possible future improvements

 - Editing tasks or projects after they've been created
 - Changing the colour of the tasks based on priority
 - Storing the tasks/projects on a server
 - Cleaning up ID/Class names to be more correct and descriptive
 - Refactoring the code so there's less duplicates and the area the code is in makes sense
